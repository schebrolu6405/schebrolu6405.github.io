# Clothing Data Set & Data Science Book

### Introduction to Data Set:

***Clothing dataset comprises of total 5000 images which is a combination of both Men wear, Women Wear and also Kids Wear. It helps us to identify the category of the cloth and also we can use them to figure out or map each image to the respective gender. The data is collected from online users through various platforms and after collecting the data, each image was labelled with a tag manually using a tool. Dataset is available in below link***

**We can use the apparel dataset to construct or upgrade existing applications. For example, we may train the model with the above set of photographs to identify the different categories, and then we can utilize this in manufacturing companies by feeding this algorithm into machines that can detect the category of different clothes and pack them in an order for delivery. Also, on ecommerce platforms, the photographs can be organized by gender and category, allowing the user to easily find the goods he is looking for.**


### Introduction to Data Science Book:

***This is the book for beginners who are fond of creating web based data visualizations. We will be introduced about one of the famous tool called D3.js which helps us to integrate these engaging visualizations to the web using Java Script. In this course we will make a tour on how to assign data to visuals and how we can create interactive visuals also web based technologies.***

**My objective is to learn new data visualization technologies on a regular basis, therefore this book attracted my interest because it relates to both my interests and my experience. I was previously unable to link my visualizations to the web, so by referring to this book, I now have confidence that I will be able to overcome the difficulty, and it also allows me to learn web-based technologies concurrently. This book assists me in learning data visualization in a different way than other tools, in this it requires me to code in order to produce these appealing visuals.**
